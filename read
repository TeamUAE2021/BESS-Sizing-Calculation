BESS SIZING CALCULATOR - CODE ANALYSIS
=====================================
WHAT THIS CODE DOES:
This Python script is a comprehensive Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) sizing and design tool. It helps engineers and project planners design optimal battery storage systems by:
Calculating the required battery capacity based on technical requirements
Selecting appropriate components from extensive equipment databases
Performing financial analysis including ROI, payback period, and lifecycle costs
Generating professional PDF reports with detailed technical specifications
Providing multiple design options with cost-benefit comparisons

HOW IT WORKS:
INPUT COLLECTION:
Gathers technical parameters (load requirements, discharge duration, C-rate, etc.)
Collects project specifics (application type, environment conditions, grid stability)
Accepts advanced parameters with sensible defaults

BATTERY SIZING CALCULATIONS:
Multi-stage capacity calculation that accounts for:
Initial capacity based on load and duration
Depth of discharge adjustments
Efficiency losses (static and cycle efficiency)
Derating factors (aging, temperature, auxiliary loads)

COMPONENT SELECTION:
The code selects optimal components from extensive databases including:
Battery systems (LFP/NMC chemistries, 1-20 MWh range)
Power Conversion Systems (PCS, 1.25-10 MW range)
Transformers (dry-type and oil-filled, 1.25-15 MVA)
Switchgear (LV, MV, and HV options)
EMS/SCADA systems (basic to professional)
Containerization options

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS:
Calculates energy and capacity revenue streams
Determines payback period and levelized cost of storage (LCOS)
Estimates Net Present Value (NPV) and approximate IRR
Projects maintenance costs and replacement schedules

REPORT GENERATION:
Creates comprehensive PDF reports with:
Technical specifications for all components
Financial projections and ROI metrics
Multiple design options with comparisons
Transportation logistics and implementation details

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
When running this code, users get:
Console output with key summary metrics
PDF report with detailed technical specifications
